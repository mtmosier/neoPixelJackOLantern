neoPixelJackOLantern
====================

NeoPixel colors in a Jack-o'-lantern


Purpose
=======

Another simple, fun project, building on what I did with the [NeoPixel Skull](http://mtmosier.com/80-arduino/75-neopixel-skull).  This one started when I saw an "eyes that follow" optical illusion project on [Instructables](http://www.instructables.com/id/Illuminated-Eyes-That-Follow-Optical-Illusion/) by member jacobjoaquin.  I was really interested in the optical illusion, but decided to put it into an artificial pumpkin instead of a box, to make a jack-o'-lantern.


Prerequisites
=============

The Adafruit NeoPixel library is required for this project.

https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_NeoPixel


Hardware
========

For the arduino, I used a generic [Arduino Pro Mini compatible microcontroller](http://www.ebay.com/itm/200957063666?_trksid=p2060778.m2749.l2649&ssPageName=STRK%3AMEBIDX%3AIT), controlling a [NeoPixel Strip](https://www.adafruit.com/products/1460).  A [Step Down Buck Converter](http://www.ebay.com/itm/400362498785?_trksid=p2059210.m2749.l2649&ssPageName=STRK%3AMEBIDX%3AIT)  See the [schematic](_schematic.png) for more information.


Installation
============

Copy the directory MTM_NeoPixel into the libraries folder of your arduino sketchbook and restart the arduino environment.  Then open Examples -> MTM_NeoPixel -> jackOLantern.  The example is very simple.  Modify anything you want and compile/upload to your board.
